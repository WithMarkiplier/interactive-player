00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.007
( music playing )

2
00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.177
( whistling )

3
00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.332
( music continues )

4
00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.824
( Tarzan yell )

5
00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.359
( grunts )
All right, we're in.

6
00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.761
You know the plan, right?

7
00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.729
What am I saying?
You practically wrote it.

8
00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.331
Everything you need is
in your bag,

9
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.701
so let's synchronize
our watches on three.

10
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.470
Three! Perfect.

11
00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.539
Now, stick to the plan
and you'll be just fine.

12
00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:17.410
But if you deviate from it
for even a single moment,

13
00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:19.277
I won't come back for you.

14
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.380
Okay? Good luck!

15
00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:22.414
( grunts )

16
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.559
Hey!

17
00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.394
What do you think
you're doing?

18
00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.496
Oh, no!

19
00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:37.896
Not the old steak trick.

20
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.732
I'm not falling for that twice.

21
00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.200
Yeah, put the steak down.

22
00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.468
I'm not even gonna look
at the steak.

23
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.403
I'm looking at you
right in the eyes.

24
00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:45.538
I looked at the steak.

25
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.539
Shh.

26
00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.908
Nicely done, buddy.

27
00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:52.410
All according to plan.

28
00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.746
And speaking of plan,

29
00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.582
looks like we are, uh,

30
00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:58.750
eh, yeah.

31
00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.720
We're moving on to phase two.

32
00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.723
Are you ready? On my go.

33
00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.258
Go!

34
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.160
( music playing )

35
00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.597
Behind you. Behind you.

36
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.701
( man whistling )

37
00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.438
He tracks the intruder,

38
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.941
quiet as a ninja
suppressing a fart in church.

39
00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.942
( chuckles )
There she is.

40
00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:26.913
Three-legged woman,
got you now.

41
00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.448
Oh, this?
It's just my gun.

42
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.951
You're safe with me, ma'am.

43
00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:33.452
( muttering, shouts )

44
00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.188
I mean, who's there?

45
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:36.322
Come back!

46
00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.827
Great job, buddy.
I'll meet you over there.

47
00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.839
All right.
We are so close to the vault.

48
00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.876
Come on.
Stay low and stay quiet.

49
00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.247
Come on, this way.

50
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.582
We're almost there.

51
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.517
Checkmate.

52
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.553
- Okay. Oh, I can
almost taste it.
- ( lock beeps )

53
00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.656
You wanna know my favorite thing
about this vault?

54
00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.458
- Go on.
- You need two keys.

55
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.660
- One for you, one for me.
- All right, here we go.

56
00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.531
- Ready? One, two, three.
- Both: Security!

57
00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:19.999
( alarm chirps )

58
00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.235
I love this job.

59
00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:27.506
Oh, crap. Oh, crap.

60
00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.975
This wasn't in the plans.

61
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.843
There are two keys
for this vault.

62
00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:33.512
We need to get them from
those guards or any guards

63
00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.847
that are moderately
less competent than those.

64
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:37.550
Why don't you go back
the way we came

65
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.986
and why don't I have
a little bit of a chat

66
00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.654
with that guard over there.

67
00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:42.722
Be back in a flash.

68
00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.529
- ( clang )
- Aah! Oh!

69
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.369
Be back in a flash.

70
00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:57.369
( clicks tongue )

71
00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.305
( snorting )

72
00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.410
( snarls )

73
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.414
( music playing )

74
00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.788
- ( clang )
- ( screaming )

75
00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:19.524
Okay.

76
00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:20.558
Ooh!

77
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.527
Oh, you got a key.

78
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:24.397
I got one, too. Come on.

79
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.899
I think these are what
we need to get in that vault.

80
00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.601
Oh, boy.

81
00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.737
Oh, this is it.

82
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.906
You ready?
Now on three.

83
00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.908
- One--
- ( buzzer )

84
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.575
What the hell?
Ah, whatever.

85
00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:38.577
( buzzer )

86
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.580
After you.

87
00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:42.849
( alarm chirps )

88
00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.486
Oh, this is it.

89
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.522
This is really it.

90
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.996
- ( glass shatters )
- This is what we've
been working towards

91
00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.597
all those years.

92
00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.799
It's finally ours.

93
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.439
This is gonna change
our lives forever.

94
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.441
- ( alarm blaring )
- Ah, crap.

95
00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.942
Um, it's fine.

96
00:05:09.975 --> 00:05:12.111
Uh, this is why we plan.

97
00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:14.447
Oh! Okay, I see two ways
out of here.

98
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.082
There just so happens
to be a sewer

99
00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.451
that runs directly
beneath this vault.

100
00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.454
I supposed we could've
gone in that way,
but that doesn't matter.

101
00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.556
We could either go through
the sewer all sneaky like,

102
00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.959
or we could go out
guns blazing.

103
00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:28.627
Yeah, I found these bad boys

104
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.962
in the pirate exhibit
on the way over here,

105
00:05:29.995 --> 00:05:31.464
but we gotta choose fast.

106
00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.631
I think they're on the way

107
00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:33.799
and they're not
gonna be friendly

108
00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:35.468
when we're in here
with the box

109
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.036
and the bomb and the gun.

110
00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.804
So, either one's good.

111
00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:40.473
Sewer will probably work
all quiet like,

112
00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:43.476
but, you know,
I like a little action.

113
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.678
But stealth is good, too.
